The idea is to take advantage of the latest advances of Machine learning and Audio processing to create innovative applications.

## Real time Audio
Smart applications are ones that instantly react to the user either in collaborative interactive way or in assistive tracking mode.
Therefore real-time processing is a mandatory aspect for such applications

## Capture
From Audio capture with I2S microphone arrays connected in microcontrollers to any sort of user input capture that is to be used to impact sound generation

## Processing
Requires hardware acceleration as all the flow is expected to run on the fly. A part of the samples relates to the analysis and learning though, that's where Python is used.

## Microcontroller
* STM32 based on ARM-M4 with USB connections
* ESP32 (wifi / BT)
* nRF52 (custom RF / BT)
